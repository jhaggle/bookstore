@* This is  like a register for all of the libraries that you want to be globally accessible for all
of your components.
And you see here that they have some default ones and they have added some default namespaces so that
everybody can see everybody else.
So when we want to add our own namespaces, we can just add them to the import so that every component
can get access to the classes. *@
